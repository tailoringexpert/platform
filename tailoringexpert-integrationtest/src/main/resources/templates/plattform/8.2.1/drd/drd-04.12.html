            <td> Worst-case Analyses (WCA) shall be accomplished at equipment level. The analysis has to be performed on
                SPF's and hazardous items with special emphasis on analogue circuitry including power supplies,
                RF-circuitry, critical interfaces e.g. ECL devices and optocouplers and CMOS as well as power-MOS
                devices which are susceptible to ionizing radiation. The parameter degradation given in ECSS-Q-ST-30-11
                and ECSS-Q-TM-30-12 shall be applied. Any adaptation of these data to the actual mission duration or the
                use of other data sources is subject for approval by DLR. Radiation dose values shall be taken from
                separate radiation analysis which takes into account the internal radiation shielding of the analysed
                equipment. In case of use of radiation non-resistant components, data on parameter degradation caused by
                radiation shall be provided by representative sample tests. At least twice the maximum degradation
                resulting from these tests shall be considered for worst case analysis. Non-compliances with the
                specified functional requirements which cannot be settled are subject to a RFW.
