                requirements (for GSE design and ground operations). Required verification data: Certificate of
                Compliance (COC) with the requirement. The objective of the safety review process is to review the
                payload, GSE, and operations for adequate safety implementation. The mission success and any scientific
                objectives of the payload are the responsibility of the PO and are beyond the scope of this document and
                process.

                the requirements of safety relevant standards as well as any applicable project specific safety
                requirements. The certification process shall be completed prior to delivery to the customer. The PO
                must present a signed certificate of the flight payload safety compliance to the PSRP executive
                secretary no later than 10 days prior to the Flight Readiness Review (FRR). The phase III SDP shall
                contain a signed Certificate of Safety Compliance. The safety analysis results shall be documented in
                the SDP, which includes applicable payload HR forms (JSC Form 542B and JSC Form 1230). Guidelines for
                completing the flight HR forms and preparing the SDP are found in JSC 26943. Each ISS HR should stand
                alone. Supporting data (e.g. certifications) shall be prepared where applicable and also submitted for
                review (phase III HRs).
