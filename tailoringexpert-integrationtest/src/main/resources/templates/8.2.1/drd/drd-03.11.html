            <td>To support hardware or software deliveries for the ISS Program, specific data must be provided to the
                using organizations as defined herein. The accumulation of this data in a hardware and / or software
                package is known as the Acceptance Data Package (ADP).<br/>
                This ADP provides a complete and verified status, including the as-built configuration, of hardware or
                software, contains information pertinent to acceptance, and enables the continuation of required
                activities by the using organization. The ADP is prepared as part of the hardware or software
                acceptance/delivery criteria and shall be maintained throughout the hardware or software life cycle
                after government acceptance. The ADP shall be maintained throughout all phases of the product life cycle
                including integrated testing, ground processing, launch site processing, on orbit, post landing, and
                maintenance/modification / refurbishment activities until the hardware or software is decommissioned.
                The ADP is a living document, to be updated as needed throughout the product life cycle to reflect the
                product configuration and status. <br/>
                This specification defines the minimum data required to accompany all hardware and software deliveries
                to or on the behalf of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This specification also
                establishes the maintenance requirements for this data during all phases of the product's life cycle
                including integration, operational, maintenance / modification and refurbishment activities.

                or software deliverable. The minimum data elements to be included for each applicable data item are
                mandatory and are specified under "Data Elements" for each corresponding data item (Tables 4.1-1 and
                4.1-2 below). <br/>
                Each element must be objectively addressed in the ADP. If the element is not applicable, it must be

                thereof) ADP Data Elements are optional unless specified in the contract.
