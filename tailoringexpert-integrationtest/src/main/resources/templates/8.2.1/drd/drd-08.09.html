                <h4>9.2 Set-up and initialisation</h4>
                The SUM shall describe any procedures to be performed by the user in order to be identified or
                authorised to access or install software on the equipment, to perform the installation, to configure the
                software, to delete or overwrite former files or data, and to enter parameters for software operation.
                <h4>9.3 Getting started</h4>
                The SUM shall include the step-by-step procedures for beginning work, including any options available,
                and a check-list for problem determination.
                <h4>9.4 Mode selection and control</h4>

                <h4>12 Analytical Index</h4>
                The SUM, if more than 40 pages, shall include an index containing a systematic list of topics from the
                user's point of view, the major synonyms and variants (especially if these are well known to users but
                are not employed in the operational manual for technical reasons), pointing to topics in the body of the
                manual by:
                <ul>
                    <li>page number,</li>
                    <li>section number,</li>
                    <li>illustration number,</li>
                    <li>primary index entry (one level of reference only).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="note">
                Index entries usefully contain auxiliary information, especially cross-references to contrasting or
                related terms.
                </p>
                For example, the entry for INSERT says "see also DELETE". <br/>
                Indexes are made particularly helpful if attention is drawn primarily to important keywords, and to
                important locations in the body of the manual. This is achieved by highlighting such entries, and by
                grouping minor entries under major headings. Indexes do not contain more than two levels of entry. If a
                single index points to different kinds of location, such as pages and illustration numbers, these are
                unambiguously distinguished, since the use of highlighting&#xa0;is not for instance sufficient to
                prevent confusion in this case.
