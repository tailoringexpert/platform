            <td>The Maintenance Plan (MP) shall support the maintenance concept adopted to satisfy operational
                requirements. Maintenance planning is the process that develops the anticipated maintenance requirements
                for the subsystems/equipment and proposes who will do required preventive maintenance tasks and where
                they will be done. The tasks shall be applicable and effective to ISS P/Ls support in accordance with
                ISS requirements. MP defines what is to do during the life cycle of an ISS P/L.<br/>
                The use of P/Ls is facing two basic needs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Safe operations: Payloads shall not endanger the life of the ISS crew or the ISS itself;</li>
                    <li>Low cost: perform scientific research to minimum cost, e.g. minimize the experiment running
                        costs.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <td>MP is an engineering process to identify maintenance needs to support the system availability during all
                project phases. As such it requires to be defined and structured in order to be well harmonized into the
                higher levels design process. A part of the process is the identification of HW that need maintenance
                and definition of which type maintenance is required.<br/>
                As a minimum, the following shall be identified and described in a MP:
                <ul>
                    <li>training programmes, facilities and equipment;</li>
                    <li>technical data necessary to enable personnel to operate and maintain the equipment;</li>
                    <li>special aids depicting tool usage, failure isolation, repair/replacement procedures and other
                        maintenance actions for training and operational maintenance.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The MP process begins with the maintenance concept (first step of the maintenance analysis).<br/>
                The maintenance concept establishes the boundaries of the activities that follow.
                Areas addressed by the concept include:
                <ul>
                    <li>a strategy for allocating maintenance tasks to the different levels of maintenance;</li>
                    <li>the repair policy regarding similar types of items contained in the subsystem/equipment;</li>
                    <li>the criteria for scheduling maintenance tasks;</li>
                    <li>the anticipated availability of resources, in gross terms, to support maintenance.</li>
                    <li>Preventive maintenance is first of all planned for items which need maintenance to assure their
                        proper functionality during the complete life cycle.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                For the general process of MP following points shall be considered:
                <ul>
                    <li>the operational scenario must be known;</li>
                    <li>the results of the first analyses, that is the identification of HW needing maintenance, must be
                        fed to the design for the incorporation of suitable set of requirements;
                    </li>
                    <li>design requirements for performance of maintenance are not part of planning, they are part of
                        maintainability; and
                    </li>
                    <li>final results of identified maintenance tasks must be fed to the maintenance task analysis &amp;
                        logistics activities for preparation of suitable support resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>In particular, the maintenance concept for an ISS P/L is something with very few degrees of
                        freedom because the type and extent of activities feasible on-orbit is quite well defined at ISS
                        level. At ISS level exist several technical requirements for design of equipment subject to
                        on-orbit maintenance. On-orbit maintenance is directly related to safety considerations.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Unplanned maintenance or corrective maintenance issues are not part of a MP. Corrective needs are
                inserted on the bases of requests in the short term execution planning, but by definition, no long term
                plan can be prepared for random events.

                period schedule the right maintenance tasks with the right associated resources taking into account of
                the operational feedbox.
