                identifies the qualified configuration. <br/>

                <p class="note">
                    A product or subsystem can only be formally declared as qualified and thus be allocated a
                    Qualification Certificate, once all the residual actions (e.g. arising from qualification reviews)
                    have been dealt with.
                </p>
                The purpose and objective of this document is to certify the qualification, and in particular that the
                product or subsystem meets the agreed initial requirements. In signing the certificate, the signing
                entities certify:
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>That the definition meets the requirements defined in the technical specification including the
                        general design rules and applicable interface control requirements, as specified in the
                        justification file.
                    </li>
                    <li>That the definition of the First Article representative of recurrent production does not call
                        into question the qualification of the product and its production process
                    </li>
                    <li>That, within the framework of the qualification certificate, all the qualification-blocking
                        reservations, raised at the end of the Qualification Review or during other First Article
                        configuration reviews, have been resolved.
