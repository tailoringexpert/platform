                <br/>
                The goal is to identify and analyse the effects of common parameters (such as radiation,
                temperature, physical location, vibration) on the particular design under investigation.<br/> <br/>
                The common-cause analysis is linked with other dependability analyses such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fault tree analysis,</li>
                    <li>Availability analysis,</li>
