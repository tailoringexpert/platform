    <h3>Contents of the Declared Process List (DPL)</h3>

    <h4>Process groups:</h4>
    Processes are classified into 17 groups depending on their type or their main use:
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Adhesive bonding</li>
        <li>Composite manufacture</li>
        <li>Encapsulation/moulding</li>
        <li>Painting/coating</li>
        <li>Cleaning</li>
        <li>Welding/brazing</li>
        <li>Crimping/stripping/wire wrapping</li>
        <li>Soldering</li>
        <li>Surface treatments</li>
        <li>Plating</li>
        <li>Machining</li>
        <li>Forming</li>
        <li>Heat treatment</li>
        <li>Special fabrication: processes developed specifically for the programme</li>
        <li>Marking</li>
        <li>Miscellaneous processes</li>
        <li>Inspection procedures.</li>
    </ol>
    If for a given project it is considered necessary to create new groups, these shall have numbers over 17.<br/>
    The process list consists of 10 columns which shall be completed as indicated below. If a particular item does not
    apply, write N.A. (Not Applicable). <br/>
    Processes which apply to, only one material (one DML item) and which are sufficiently defined in column 5 of the DML
    should not appear in the DPL (unless they are critical).

    <h4>COLUMN 1: Item number</h4>
    This consists of the process identifier and the user code. It takes the form of e.g. "1.2.1.SSEX"<br/>
    Characteristics of the item number are:
    <ul>
        <li>The sub supplier shall be identified by an agreed code for the project.</li>
        <li>One only per process type.</li>
        <li>Does not change during the life of the process list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>COLUMN 2: Process identification</h4>
    The correct and standard identification of the process shall be indicated, e.g. the process name or title: bonding,
    coating or soldering.

    <h4>COLUMN 3: Specification</h4>
    The name or abbreviation of the process executor shall be identified. A reference shall be made to the associated
    procedure, e.g. national, international, EN, ISO, ECSS or company in-house, together with the issue, revision and
    date.

    <h4>COLUMN 4: Process description</h4>
    A short description of the process shall be entered.

    <h4>COLUMN 5: Use and location</h4>
    The codes entered shall define the location of the process with respect to the:
    <ul>
        <li>subsystem,</li>
        <li>particular piece of equipment (box or item),</li>
        <li>use of the equipment (e.g. a structural element, thermal control, electrical insulation).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>COLUMN 6:</h4>
    This column number is not used.

    <h4>COLUMN 7: Associated Items number</h4>
    The associated material list (DML) or mechanical parts list (DMPL) with the process shall be entered.

    <h4>COLUMN 8: Criticality</h4>
    Enter "C" for critical or "N" for non-critical.<br/>
    If a process is considered to be critical, references to the relevant RFA shall be entered.

    <h4>COLUMN 9.1: Supplier reference, prime comments and approval</h4>
    The purpose of this is to enter any additional information that may be necessary in order to achieve customer's
    approval. This information comprises reference and issue of the RFA / approval, processes justification file,
    evaluation reports and waivers. These documents must be made available to customer on request.

    <h4>COLUMN 9.2: Supplier's approval</h4>
    The supplier reference and approval columns shall be used to enter any additional information that can be necessary
    to obtain customer approval.<br/>
    The supplier approval status code shall be selected from Table.

                reasons. The use of such processes shall be reduced to a minimum. All deviation requests shall be
                approved by the customer. The concession number shall be entered as a comment.
