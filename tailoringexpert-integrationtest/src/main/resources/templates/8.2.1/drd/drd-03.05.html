                The purpose of the Cleanliness and contamination control plan (C&amp;CCP) is to establish the data
                content requirements for the cleanliness and contamination control plan. This DRD does not define
                format, presentation or delivery requirements for the cleanliness and contamination control plan (C&amp;CCP),
                which can vary depending on product level (i.e. equipment, subsystem, system), and specific contractual
                requirements.<br/> <br/>
                A cleanliness and contamination control plan is prepared in order to set out
                the ways in which the required cleanliness levels are achieved and maintained during the life of the
                programme, from design to end-of-life. <br/>
                As it is of fundamental importance for the space system's performance, the C&amp;CCP is established as
                early as possible in the programme, in order to properly address the design. <br/>
                The C&amp;CCP is prepared for all levels of configuration items defined in the project at the following
                levels:
                <div>

                        <li>Equipment</li>
                    </ul>
                    The C&amp;CCP is based on the requirements defined by the cleanliness requirements specification
                    (CRS). <br/>
                    The supplier is responsible for this document. <br/>
                    The C&amp;CCP is prepared in collaboration with experimenters and engineers.
