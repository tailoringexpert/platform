    <h4>Justification requirements concerning waived EEE-Parts:</h4>
    At least the following justification should be provided:
    <ol>
        <li>Data should be provided sufficiently detailing why the proposed part is needed including advantages and
            disadvantages (technical, availability, effect on cost/price, effect on delivery schedule).
        </li>
        <li>Provision of data that substantiates that the electrical performance characterizations are compatible with
            the life reliability assurance criteria and the application. <br/>
            For example:
            <ul>
                <li>When a part is proposed for an application beyond the recommended device parameters criteria
                    supplemental justification should be given.
                </li>
                <li>For example, if a tantalum capacitor is intended for use at a frequency not recommended by the
                    typical application, objective data should be presented to show that the capacitor will perform the
                    desired circuit function without degradation of reliability over the expected life cycle mission of
                    the system or equipment.
                </li>
                <li>When any part is proposed for an application in which circuit performance depends on a
                    characteristic or parameter that is not controlled by the component specification, justification for
                    use of the part shall include substantive data to show that the parameter will be maintained.
                </li>
                <li>Such justification should include data that shows that interrelated parameters are controlled to the
                    extent necessary to assure that the critical parameter will be consistently within established
                    limits or that supplementary parameter limits have not been imposed by specification which add
                    prohibitive cost or effect availability.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Therefore - Copy of relevant data sheet should be provided if parameters of proposed device are different to
            required controlled device parameters.
        </li>
        <li>Describe in detail whether and how it affects the product performance, PA, dependability, safety, operation
            and logistics.
        </li>
        <li>Effected quantity.</li>
        <li>Part relevant in-house screening programme (copy from data book if available).</li>
