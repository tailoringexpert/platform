        <h4>Flight Safety Certificate (FSC) Completion Instructions</h4>
        General Instructions
        <ul>
            <li>The Flight Safety Certificate (FSC) is the tool that is used by the International Partners
                (IPs) to communicate to each other the safety of cargo items transported or
                stowed/operated in each other's vehicles and segments.
            </li>
            <li>A FSC should reference one or more items on the applicable transportation manifest or
                a currently on-orbit item requiring updated operations/stowage approval.
            </li>
            <li>If approval for multiple items is to be requested on a single FSC, they must be
                reasonably similar (such as all belonging to a single system) and be requesting
                approval for the same vehicles and mission phases.
            </li>
            <li>For payloads/experiments, the FSC is also used to document both the HW's safe
                design life and operational life in addition to providing the formal safety endorsement of
                flight readiness to the ISSP.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Fields</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Certificate Number:<br/>
                A unique identifier created and serialized by the requesting-side IP. For the purposes of commonality
                and ease of tracking ISS_OE_906, Flight Safety Certificates, the certificate numbers will conform to the
                following pattern which is documented in SSP 30599 and in SSP 50146 Attachment D.<br/>
                For non-experiment cargo the format is as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mission Number,</li>
                    <li>IP,</li>
                    <li>Mission Phase and category (1 or 2 as determined using the ISS_OE_907),</li>
                    <li>sequential number,</li>
                </ul>
                where:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mission Number is the first flight on which the HW is delivered to ISS. Mission Number is to be
                        given in the form of 46P, 29S, HTV3, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>TR will be used to designate certification for the transportation phase only. OP will be used to
                        designate certification for the operation phase only. If the certificate applies to both
                        transportation and operation on ISS, rather than identifying for example TR-OP1, the TR and OP
                        will be omitted. Thus a number alone indicates certification for both phases. If it is desired
                        to list different categories for transportation and operation on ISS, the categories will be
                        separated by a dash; e.g. TR1-OP2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sequential Number is a three-digit number denoting the serial number of the
                        FSC/ISS_OE_906 within the set of safety certificates for the given mission.
                        There is one numerical sequence for all flight phases and cargo categories, for
                        each mission.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                For experiment cargo the format is as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Experiment Designator,</li>
                    <li>Space Agency,</li>
                    <li>Category,</li>
                    <li>Expedition,</li>
                    <li>Sequential number</li>
                </ul>
                where
                <ul>
                    <li>The Experiment Designator is the designation of the experiment within a program of experiments
                        (e.g. for Russian experiments, MBI No. – for medical and biological experiments).
                    </li>
                    <li>Space Agency is the designator of the space agency which issues the experiment for use on the
                        ISS.
                    </li>
                    <li>Category is 1 or 2, by flight phase, as determined using the ISS_OE_907 "Multilateral Category 1
                        Constraints" form.
                    </li>
                    <li>Expedition is the number of the Expedition when the experiment is planned to be performed within
                        the ISS program, e.g. ISS25.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sequential Number is a three-digit number designating the number of the FSC/ISS_OE_906 within
                        that specific Expedition.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                For NASA items, the Certificate Number will be generated by the appropriate NASA safety review panel POC
                after the FSC is submitted for approval. IP Certificate Numbers shall be provided/maintained by the
                respective IP safety organization
            </li>
            <li>Cargo Item Provider:<br/>
                Put a check mark in the box corresponding to the hardware item's owner (i.e. check the box marked
                "NASA").
            </li>
            <li>Cargo Identification:<br/>
                In the Cargo Item Name box, list part name exactly as written on the applicable flight manifest. In the
                corresponding Part Number box, list the part number exactly as it is written in the applicable flight
                manifest.
                <p class="note">
                    An attachment may be used if a FSC contains more items than will fit in the allotted spaces, or as
                    needed to provide a detailed description of the content).
                </p>
                For multiple hardware items, number them sequentially so that they can be matched to their descriptions
                in section VIII. <br/>
                e.g.:
                <ol>
                    <li>EVA Tool, XYZ-123</li>
                    <li>EVA Tool Storage Bag, ABC-789</li>
                    <li>EVA Fasteners, ZYX-345</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Transportation Safety Requirements:<br/>
                This section identifies the vehicle(s) on which you are requesting permission to be transported or
                returned/disposed. It also identifies which safety process was followed to request permission, which
                safety requirements were complied with, and which category the HW items in question fit into.
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: Select the vehicle for which you are requesting permission for the HW to
                        be transported or returned/disposed.<br/>
                        <p class="note">
                            ESA does not require approval for items to be disposed of on ATV.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 2: Select the appropriate safety process document that is to be followed
                        for requesting permission for the selected vehicles and segments. For example:<br/>
                        Safety data exchanges through the JARSWG are in accordance with SSP 50146 Attachment D. This
                        includes Russian cargoes and payloads on the ISS and U.S. Visiting Vehicles, and US cargoes and
                        payloads on the Progress, Soyuz, and Russian Segment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 3: Select the appropriate category that the HW fits into. Category 1 is defined by the
                        form, ISS_OE_907. Category 2 consists of those items that do not meet the constraints of
                        Category 1
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 4: Select the appropriate launch requirements documents that the hardware item in question
                        must comply with. The HW provider is REQUIRED to assess each HW item for compliance with the
                        safety requirements of the vehicle on which the item is to be transported or returned/disposed.
                        The HW item must meet the safety requirements of the applicable transport vehicle when subjected
                        to that vehicle's specific environments (vibration, shock and acceleration loading, depress
                        rates, humidity and temperature ranges, etc.).
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 5: If permission to return or to be disposed of on the Soyuz is requested, specify whether
                        only disposal, only return, or both disposal and return are being requested by checking the
                        appropriate boxes in the header row next to the headings "Return" and "Disposal".
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Operations/Stowage Safety Requirements:<br/>
                This section identifies the segments in which you are requesting permission to be stowed or operated. It
                also identifies which safety process was followed to request permission, which safety requirements were
                complied with, and which category the HW items in question fit into.
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: Select the segment for which you are requesting permission for the hardware to be stowed
                        or operated.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 2: Select the appropriate safety process document that is to be followed for requesting
                        permission for the selected segments. For example: Safety data exchanges through the JARSWG are
                        in accordance with SSP 50146 Attachment D.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 3: Select the appropriate category that the hardware fits into. Category 1 is defined by
                        the form, ISS_OE_907. Category 2 consists of those items that do not meet the constraints of
                        Category 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 4: Select the appropriate Stowage/Operations requirements documents that the hardware item
                        in question must comply with. The hardware provider is REQUIRED to assess each hardware item for
                        compliance with the safety requirements of the segment on which the item is to be stowed or
                        operated.
                    </li>

        <h4>Function/How it Works:</h4>
        General executive summary-type description on what the hardware is, what it does, and how it works. The scope of
        this section should be to include enough detail to give someone familiar with spaceflight hardware (but
        unfamiliar with the system) a general understanding of what the hardware is/does. Include in this section a
        reference to the document number that was used to certify the item for flight (in the case of GFE items, this
        document number would be the GCAR)

        <h4>Construction/Materials:</h4>
        This section outlines what the hardware is made of and how it is constructed/put together. For each component,
        the materials and construction method (if applicable) should be listed.<br/>
        Discuss in additional detail in this section:
        <ul>
            <li>Any materials higher than Tox 0</li>
            <li>Any biological materials</li>
            <li>Any liquids or gases (including alcohol or other volatiles)</li>
            <li>Any non-standard materials</li>
            <li>Any permanent magnets</li>
            <li>Any cells/batteries (include chemistry, quantity, manufacturer/model number, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Transport Configuration:</h4>
        This section should outline the configuration in which the IP will transport your HW and generically how it is
        to be packed into the IP's launch/return/disposal vehicle (i.e. whether it is unpackaged, in a foam-packed hard
        case or in a soft Nomex bag / crew transfer bag (CTB), if your hardware needs to be soft-stowed or needs to be
        hard-mounted in the vehicle etc.). Mark as N/A if the FSC is an operations-only certificate.
        <blockquote class="note">
            For Soyuz launches and returns, two specific statements are required to be included (reference П32928-103):
            <ul>
                <li>The HW will not create a hazard if/when the Soyuz depressurizes.</li>
                <li>The HW will not create a hazard under the Soyuz acceleration and shock environments.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Stowage Configuration:</h4>
        This section should outline the configuration and location in which the item will be stowed longterm in the IP's
        segment. Mark N/A if the FSC is not for stowage or if the item will only be temp-stowed in the IP's segment.
        (Temp stowage is when there is a defined time limit on the stowage in a given area and/or a different, planned,
        long-term location for an item that is being stowed in a given area, and the time limit or need to temp stow is
        driven by a specific activity/constraint in the long-term location.)

        <h4>Weight, Dimensions:</h4>
        State overall weights in metric units followed by the dimensions in metric units only for cargo packing
        purposes. If necessary, specify that the weight is for multiple cargo items together, in the form of:<br/>
        XX.X kg, XX x XX x XX cm (for XX)<br/>
        e.g. (for 6 items packed together): 10.7 kg, 25 x 52 x 7.8 cm (for 6)

        <h4>Safe Design Life:</h4>
        (Experiments only) Document the time duration or number of mission’s limits of the certification. Design life is
        the time period during which a payload can be retained at or restored to the specified operational condition
        using prescribed resources and procedures. Design life must include ground and on-orbit time, including passive
        stowage.

        <h4>Safe Operational Life:</h4>
        (Experiments only) Document the time duration or number of mission’s limits of the hardware. Operational life is
        defined as the time period for which the payload will perform its intended function within specified performance
        limits under stated conditions without any safety-related corrective maintenance, recalibration or repair.
        Operational life must include all ground and onorbit time. Operational life is determined by the safety-related
        component (e.g. seals, batteries, relief valves) with the soonest expiration date. Operational life includes the
        entire on-orbit interval in which the payload will be expected to remain operational, including stowage
        between planned operations.<br/>
        The design life and operational life must be rigorously assessed, and are based on the certified life of
        safety-related component(s) i.e. seals, relief valves, regulators, batteries, structures. They cannot be based
        on arbitrary factors such as estimated mission duration. A specific date or reference document must be provided
        to determine when the design/operational life expires. For example, if a payload's safe operational life is
        determined by a seal with a specific expiration date, that date would be noted on the certificate as the
        operational expiration date. If a payload's safe operational life begins upon ground processing, launch or
        activation, then the initiating event must be referenced on the certificate (for example: One year from
        completion of ground processing operations on XX/XX/XXXX).
